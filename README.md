# Introduction

This product registry is a learning project to view and compare product longevity and environmental impact of various products

This project is a MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, Node.js) application made
of two processes:
   1. an Express "server" providing API support for retrieving and submitting
   data from the backend
   1. a React "client" providing a web-based UI

This project also leverages a cloud-based instance of MongoDB for storing
and retrieving data.

# Working with this Codebase
## Starting the Express server

In a command shell (CMD, PowerShell, Terminal, etc.) run the commands:
1. `cd server`
1. `npm install`
1. `npm run start`

The server is now running on port *3000*.

## Starting the React client

In a command shell run the commands:
1. `cd client`
1. `npm install`
1. `npm run start`

Your browser should open to `http://localhost:4444`.  The React development
system is running on port *4444*.
